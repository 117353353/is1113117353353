        <p><strong>Uses of Cloud Computing:</strong>
        Uses of cloud computing include Storing large amounts of data relatively cheaply. It is often used to backup important files.
        It allows companies to obtain and develope I.T infrastures cheaply and hassle-free with ready to use platforms already available.
        The cloud offers a secure way of storing data and is easier to use than ever before. <p/>

        <p><strong>How I use of Cloud Computing:</strong>
         I use cloud computing in many ways. I backup all my photos on my phone to dropbox. This application securely backups my photos and
         files with only a small fee being charged. I also use Cloud 9, a system which allows me to create, edit and save HTML documents
         Cloud 9 stores everything using cloud computing.</p>
