        It allows companies to obtain and develope I.T infrastures cheaply and hassle-free with ready to use platforms already available.

         I use cloud computing in many ways. I backup all my photos on my phone to dropbox. This application securely backups my photos and
         files with only a small fee being charged. I also use Cloud 9, a system which allows me to create, edit and save HTML documents
         Cloud 9 stores everything using cloud computing.</p>
