        Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a strategy for managing all your companys relationships and interactions with your customers and potential customers. 
        It helps you improve your profitability.More commonly, when people talk about CRM they are usually referring to a customer relationship managment system, a tool which helps with contact
        management, sales management, workflow processes, productivity and more.Customer Relationship Management enables you to focus on your organisations
        relationships with individual people – whether those are customers, service users, colleagues or suppliers. CRM is not just for sales. Some of the biggest gains
        in productivity can come from moving beyond CRM as a sales and marketing tool and embedding it in your business – from HR to customer services and supply-chain management.
