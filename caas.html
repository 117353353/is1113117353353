          <h3><p><strong>What is Gmail?:</strong></h3>
          </br>
          Gmail is one of the most popular webmail services out there. Gmail began in 2004 as what would turn out to be an extended 5-year beta and didn’t become open to the public until 2007.Gmail was one of the first web-based email products to
          offer a gigabyte of initial storage, trumping many of the other popular webmail services at the time, who typically offered 2 to 4 megabytes. Over time, Google has continued to increase storagecapacity and now offers 15 gigabytes of initial
          storage when you sign up for a new account!

          <h2><strong>Why Gmail is so popular?</strong></h2>
           </br>
             
        
         <li><strong>Gmail Provides Plenty of Storage</strong>   
           </br>
           Gmail provides over 15 GB of free storage, which allows you to save all your messages for future reference. NOTE: This 15 GB is shared with Google Drive and Google+ Photos.
           Best of all, Google is always increasing your account’s storage capacity, so you don’t need to worry about running out of space, and if you do, you can always purchase more!

           <li><strong>Conversations in Emails are Organized into Threads</strong>
            </br>
            Emails are automatically grouped according to subject line. When you receive a reply to a message, all previous related messages are displayed in a collapsible vertical thread,
            making it easy to see the entire conversation and review what has been discussed previously.

            </br>
            
            <li><strong>Thorough Malware and Virus-Checking Features</strong>
            </br>
            Gmail constantly updates its anti-malware and anti-virus scanners to give you the most up-to-date protection possible.
            File attachments are saved on Google’s servers, but if malware or a virus makes it through in a message, Gmail displays a warning and immediately quarantines the offending message.
            You cannot turn the virus filtering off, and it does prevent you from sending an executable (.exe) file as an attachment. If you really need to send anything like an .exe file, you will 
            first need to place it in a container such as a .zip or .rar file.

            </br>
            
            <li><strong>Excellent Spam Filtering</strong>
            </br>
           Gmail has some pretty excellent spam filtering, stray messages do get through occasionally but for the most part, you’re unlikely to see messages you don’t want to see.

            <li><strong>Quickly and Easily Find Messages Using the Search Box</strong>
            </br>
           You can quickly find email messages using the power of Google Search, which is tied into your Gmail allowing for instant results. Simply enter your search criteria in the search 
           field and click the blue button or hit “enter.”
