          <h3><p><strong>What is Amazon?:</strong></h3>
          </br>
          Amazon is one of the largest online stores in the world. It offers a place for people and business to buy and sell goods. Both the goods and money are handled by
          amazon making the whole process more secure. Amazon are a global giant is the ebusiness market and has been growing and growing steadily in the last number of years. 
          It is owned by Jeff Bezos who is now one of the world richest people thanks to Amazon.

          <h2><strong>Why Amazon is so popular?</strong></h2>
           </br>
             
        
         <li><strong>Amazon Gets Personal</strong>   
           </br>
           As consumers, one-third of us want a more personalized shopping experience, says research from Infosys. That’s been shown to boost conversions for other retailers,
           and it’s something Amazon delivers.Amazon rocks personalization. In fact, it’s a little bit scary how much they know and how quickly they can respond. Over the years,
           I’ve seen their on-site recommendations get better and better till almost every product recommended is something that interests me.

           </br>
           
           <li><strong>Checkout Is Easy!</strong>
            </br>
            If you get one of those emails, buying the product is quick and simple. A Conversion XL study outlined a 5-click process, but if you’re already logged in and using 1-Click
            ordering (such as when buying a Kindle book, for example), you can complete the purchase in 2 or 3 clicks. Since slow and complex shopping carts kill conversions, this speed
            to come back later, the ability to resume where you stopped is a big advantage. Notifications of price changes at checkout are another encouragement to complete a purchase.
            Credit card purchases with Amazon are generally easier than on other sites. Once you have added your card, you only have to enter it again if delivering to a new address. While
            that’s a minor annoyance, if you’re mostly ordering items for home delivery, it’s not a major issue.

            <li><strong>Social Proof – Lots of It</strong>
            </br>
           An article on KISSmetrics shows the importance of positive social proof and the influence of other people’s stories on the purchase process. It cites research showing that two-thirds
           of shoppers are more likely to buy if there are product ratings and reviews. Amazon has both, making it my first port of call for online shopping and product research.
            </li>
            
            </br>
            
            <li><strong>Product Images, Videos and Descriptions</strong>
            </br>
            A Visual Website Optimizer study found that using large product images can boost conversions by 9%. As we’ve shown before, images are great for showcasing product benefits, adding 
            credibility, providing context and firing buyers’ imagination.Amazon doesn’t nail this every time, in my view, but when they do, it’s a beautiful thing. While there are still some
            products without images, many now add video to the mix, enabling buyers to see products in use.Not only can you get a 360° view of most products but you can see color variations as well
            and you can look inside books. All of this helps you make the decision to buy.

            <li><strong>Convenient Filtering, Navigation and Search</strong>
            </br>
        Navigation and search are two aspects of what Moz calls the Holy Grail of E-commerce Optimization, and Amazon does this well. Considering the number of products available for sale, it’s amazing
        that you don’t feel overwhelmed. In part, this is because of excellent filtering.In this example, I was able to search for a laptop, not just on price and star rating, but based on operating system,
        brand, internal memory and more. It’s a great way to build confidence that you’re finding the right product that meets your needs.Amazon also does a great job of showcasing the most popular items
        in a particular category, while providing easy access to a full directory for easy refinement.
